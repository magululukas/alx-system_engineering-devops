Hi,
I welcome you to this folder, Its intended to hold bash scripts explaining some concepts in bash.
Some of the concepts to be handled include;-
1. Use of command-line commands like;-
   *echo
    *cat
     *head
    *tail
    *find
   * wc
    *sort
    *uniq
    *grep
    *tr
    *rev
    *cut
    *passwd (5) (i.e. man 5 passwd)
2. Shell, I/O Redirection
3. Special Characters
The whole thing will be helping us understand the concept number_2.
Cheers as you explore.........!
